## Intro
This is a resource to aid in giving cyber security presentations, aimed at less technical audiences.
The slide show itself is very sparce, with the bulk of content intended to be delivered verbally, and summarised in the included hand-out.

The slideshow can be navigated either with arrow keys or vim bindings: use <kbd>↓</kbd> to cycle through slides within a section, and <kbd>→</kbd> to go to the next section. Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> at anytime to see an overview. Full-screen mode can be enabled with <kbd>F</kbd>, and <kbd>V</kbd> can be used to pause or resume the presentation.


> About: _I wrote this in 2018, while in the Army, and it was part of a security seminar I gave to the senior officers within our unit._
